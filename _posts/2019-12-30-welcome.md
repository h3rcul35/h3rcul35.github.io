## Introductory Post

Hello reader!!

I am starting this habit of blogpost writing primarily for two reasons:
1. Knowledge sharing with interested audience. I read 5-10 books every month related to Economy, Business, Technology and Security.
2. Am getting older! I felt the need to document the readings and thoughts in a public domain so as to read it or refer people to it when a healthy conversation demands the recollection. 

Apart from reading books, I spend most of my time experimenting with the security of operating system and applications. So my blogposts will be of two categories, Security and Books. 

Am going to try something new for blogs! Writing mini-blog. Sometime's the content is very less and mostly a vague conclusion or perception which yet deserves a documentation. I will add a section for mini-blogs too! 

With the rise of machines and technologies, lets rise up to a better user of the technology without compromising security & privacy. Excited to enter the much hyped 2020! 
Several books written in 2014/2015 had high expectations of this magic year. 

Happy life and happy magic year!!
